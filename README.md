# AirBnB Clone Project

## 🎯 Project Goal
This is a full-stack clone of AirBnB, allowing users to browse property listings, view details, and make bookings.

## 💻 Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (React)
- **Backend**: Node.js/Express or Python/Django (to be decided)
- **Database**: MongoDB or PostgreSQL
- **Design**: Figma
- **Version Control**: Git & GitHub

## 🎨 UI/UX Design Planning

### 🎯 Design Goals
- Create an intuitive booking flow (easy to search, book, pay)
- Keep visual design consistent across all pages
- Ensure fast loading times
- Prioritize mobile responsiveness (works well on phones)

### ⭐ Key Features
- Property search and filtering (by price, location, dates)
- Detailed property view with photos and reviews
- Secure checkout process
- User login/register functionality

### 📄 Primary Pages

| Page | Description |
|------|-----------|
| **Property Listing View** | Displays a grid of available properties with filters (e.g., price, bedrooms). |

| **Simple Checkout View** | Minimal form to confirm booking and payment details before finalizing. |

### 💬 Importance of User-Friendly Design
A well-designed booking system reduces user frustration, increases trust, and leads to more completed bookings (higher conversion). Clear navigation, readable text, fast load times, and mobile compatibility are essential for a great user experience.
